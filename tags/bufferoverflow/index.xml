      <description>What is Smashing the Stack You may have heard the term buffer overflow or smashing the stack but what does this mean? Simply this just means that a program hasnt checked its inputs and important data on the stack has been overwritten (such as a functions return address). Lets have a quick look at what a functions stack frame may look like
3: Arguments 2: local buffer (64 chars) 1: Frame Pointer 0: Return Address  So if the program is vulnerable and doesnt do any bounds checking when writing data into the local buffer then that data can literally overflow the buffer overwriting the values that come after it (such as the return address).</description>
